  <h1 class="hero__title">The 7 Best iPhone Photography Apps</h1>
  <p>The last few years have seen an explosion in the number of different photo apps on the App Store, and the things you can do with photo apps these days are truly amazing. There are tens of thousands of photo apps out there, both paid and free, and many iPhoneographers have downloaded dozens of apps only to find out that they don’t use most of them.</p>
  <p>After going through countless photo apps I decided to take a different approach and only focus on the few apps that can do everything I really need. It also makes more sense to only focus on the few really good apps and not waste your time on other apps that you don’t need. So without further ado, here are the seven apps I use to create all my iPhone photos</p>

    <h2 class="card__headline">Snapseed</h2>
    <img src="img/Snapseed.png" class="card__image" alt="Card Image">
    <div class="card__content"><p>If I could only have one photo app on my iPhone, I would probably go for Snapseed. It’s the app that I have used for editing more photos than any other photo app, and often it’s all I need for post-processing. Many talented iPhoneographers have also praised Snapseed in our interviews. And if you’re only getting started with iPhoneography, it’s the one photo editing app that you should learn before everything else.</p></div>
    <div class="card__success"><span>Success</span>: Powerful, easy-to-use photo editor</div>
    <div class="card__weakness"><span>Weakness</span>: Some effects introduce excessive grain</div>

    <h2 class="card__headline">VSCO</h2>
    <img src="img/VSCO.png" class="card__image" alt="Card Image">
    <div class="card__content">
      <p>VSCO is a great camera replacement and photo editing app. Its greatest strength lies in simple one-tap editing presets that can be used to add a unique classic-photography look and feel to your photos. Most one-tap editing apps have terrible filters that will only ruin your photos, but VSCO effects are a lot more subtle, and they almost always look great.</p>
      <p>VSCO also offers some really great custom editing options, such as the ability to add tint to the highlights or the shadows of the photo separately. If you’re looking for an app that can easily add a classic photography look to your photos, you can’t go wrong with VSCO. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card__success"><span>Success</span>: Great one-tap filter effects and custom editing options</div>
    <div class="card__weakness"><span>Weakness</span>: User interface can be confusing at first</div>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco/id588013838?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3v39L" class="card__download">Download for free</a>

    <div class="card__number">03</div>
    <h2 class="card__headline">Camera+</h2>
    <img src="img/Camera+.png" class="card__image" alt="Card Image">
    <div class="card__content">
      <p>I tried many camera replacement apps until I finally settled on Camera+. Of course, there are other apps with similar functionality (e.g. ISO and shutter speed control, manual focus, image stabilization, etc.), but none of them are as elegant and intuitive as Camera+ is today.</p>
      <p>Besides excellent camera controls, Camera+ also comes with powerful photo editing tools - including one-touch scene modes, extensive advanced tools in the ‘Lab’, filters and frames. This makes it a great addition to the other photo editing apps mentioned in this report</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card__success"><span>Success</span>: Powerful camera app with manual exposure controls</div>
    <div class="card__weakness"><span>Weakness</span>: Editing filters can look over-processed</div>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera+/id329670577?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3v39L" class="card__download">Download for $2.99</a>

    <h2 class="card__headline">Pro HDR X</h2>
    <img src="img/Pro HDRX.png" class="card__image" alt="Card Image">
    <div class="card__content">
      <p>HDR or High Dynamic Range is a photography technique that combines differently exposed versions of the same photo into one composite image so that both the highlights and the shadows are properly exposed. You can take HDR photos with the iPhone’s built-in camera app, but if you want a stronger HDR effect, you should definitely check out Pro HDR X.</p>
      <p>Pro HDR X helps you take powerful and natural-looking HDR photos with your iPhone while keeping the detail in both shadows and highlights. One downside of HDR apps such as Pro HDR X is that it takes longer to capture HDR photos, so you don’t want to have any movement in the frame while the photo is taken. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card__success"><span>Success</span>: Powerful HDR app that creates natural results</div>
    <div class="card__weakness"><span>Weakness</span>: HDR effect can looks unnatural if applied too strongly</div>

    <h2 class="card__headline">SKRWT</h2>
    <img src="img/SKRWT.png" class="card__image" alt="Card Image">
    <div class="card__content">
      <p>How often have you taken a photo and, once you got home, wished you could straighten up those wonky buildings? Or wanted to fix the lens distortion that can be seen in some photos? Not many apps offer solutions for these problems and those that do often don’t do it well. Thankfully SKRWT makes it simple and does it really well - even autocropping the photo to save you time.</p>
      <p>In addition it gives you easy access to EXIF information about your images, provides fine rotation control, advanced cropping and can save your images in superior RAW mode.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card__success"><span>Success</span>: Fixing perspective problems and lens distortion</div>
    <div class="card__weakness"><span>Weakness</span>: Very little in-app help - so watch the video tutorials</div>

    <h2 class="card__headline">Mextures</h2>
    <img src="img/mextures.png" class="card__image" alt="Card Image">
    <div class="card__content">
      <p>There are many apps that you can use to apply textures, scratches and light-leaks to your photos, but none of them are as good as Mextures. With a simple user interface, the ability to stack a seemingly infinite number of layers, interesting blending modes and a large collection of high-quality textures, Mextures really is the best app for applying textures and other similar effects to your iPhone photos.</p>
      <p>Another really cool thing about Mextures is the ability to quickly edit photos using formulas. You can either use one of the formulas that has been created for you by professional photographers, or you can create your own formula to quickly apply the same adjustments to multiple photos.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card__success"><span>Success</span>: Stack many effects with different blending modes & formulas</div>

    <img src="img/touchretouch.png" class="card__image" alt="Card Image">
    <div class="card__content">
      <p>Have you ever taken a great photo and then noticed a mark or blemish that ruins the image? Or maybe you simply want to erase one or more objects that don’t work within the composition. TouchRetouch is a simple yet powerful app that lets you quickly remove unwanted objects from your iPhone photos.</p>
      <p>Simply brush over the areas you want to remove so that they’re highlighted in red, then tap the Start button. Selected objects will be replaced by pixels from the surrounding area, therefore this app works best when the object you want to remove is surrounded by simple detail such as sky, grass, water, etc.</p>
